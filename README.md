# ICSM Vocabularies
This repository contins vocabularies owned and/or managed by the [Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping](https://www.icsm.gov.au/).

**NOTE**: as of April, 2021, this system is still in early development.

These _vocabularies_ are controlled lists of terms formulated according to the [Simple Knowlege Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) taxonomy data model.

All the vocabularies in the [vocabularies/](vocabularies/) folder of the `main` branch of this repository are automatically loaded into ICSM's vocabulary publication system which can be seen online at:

* **<http://icsm.surroundaustralia.com>**
  * _temporary location only: will change to a permanent home!_
